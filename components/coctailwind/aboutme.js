						Hey there! My name is Chris Sev and I founded a web dev tutorial
						site Scotch.io. We were able to grow to 4M monthly pageviews and
						$300,000 yearly revenue. Scotch.io was acquired byDigitalOcean in
						November 2019. Nowadays I'm in search of the best ways to develop
						and design a business. Hope you enjoy this course and my other one
						MakeReactApps.com.
